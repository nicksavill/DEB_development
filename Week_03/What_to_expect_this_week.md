### Week 3
This week is about plotting and charts.  I will give a short presentation describing some of the principals and some key types of charts, then the workshop will show how seaborn can be used to generate and modify plots.  The second workshop will use an example from data on Darwin's finchs to show what can be done with plots to explore data.
