## Cheat Sheet
    Provide pandas cheatsheet 
    https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf
    Add note on which class this was first used in.

### Find best way to run warm up quizzes
    LEARN, as need to be realted to student - assessed.  Make dependant on slides shown in class.
    Wooclap for class 1 - have signed up, need to test

### Check set up for notebooks 
    Met with James Stix, all looks good.

### Look through other examples of courses
    Discovery:
    https://github.com/graemecowan/Discovery1_2023.git
    Variation:
    https://github.com/nicksavill/Variation1.git
    Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's course (she's left now)
        https://datasciencebox.org/
    Charlotte Desvages MSc intro course
         https://github.com/pypr-2122/table-of-contents/

#### Notebooks testing
 Polish notebooks - adding more for students to do and explore
 See how the notebooks run on Noteable
 Test the course on potential demonstrators

#### More examples if space?
Add more small data analysis examples from papers
Look out good examples for the class tests
Add pop gen clustering for week 8? (week 8 is pop genetics genes and evolution course
Add phlyogenetic drawing example as an extra to week 10/11)?  https://github.com/taylor-lindsay/phylogenetics/blob/master/turtles/turtles.ipynb
Add spatial plotting as an extra?

### Assessment 
Weekly quizzes at beginning of each class (total 20%) 
    Expect HIGH - is measuring attendance as well. Need to write 55 questions.  Top 7/11 SC get-out.  No extension.
    Run via LEARN using slides in the class. Let them know which classes will have tests.

Portfolio (15%) 
    Expect HIGH most got >70 in first year. up to 40% will get the full 15% individual notebook plus mid-course reflection on hypothesis. 
    Force Fail if fail to upload notebook (if possible)

Class test (25%) 
    Expect LOW.
    Computer issues? Done on noteable – can switch to BTO laptops if needed
    Re-sits? Summer work same time limit, online.
    Force fail if miss (if possible)

Poster 40% (assessed by staff (30%) and peers (10%)) 
    Expect HIGH
    Need to write Rubric for poster
    Need to write guide to project

    Shifts – 40 posters per shift.  2 staff each. 
    Student marking online – assign 2 posters per student to mark and give feedback
    Anonymised.  Median student mark counts for 10%
    Peer weighting? WebPA

It is quite possible all will get As and that is OK.
Missing Portfolio or class test is a force fail. Otherwise need 40% total to pass course

#### Learn site
Is set up, need to populate....
Need to add in all course team members.
Maintained by DepCO?

#### Portfolio
To include questsions on  Bias and on Ethics (any material here send to Allison)
To include justification of hypothesis picked
To include uploading portfolio: 
    Please add your Jupyter notebook containing the analysis of your flavour dataset, using python, pandas, and seaborn. Your notebook should:
    say which flavour dataset you are using
	state the specific analysis question you are addressing
    load the relevant dataset and other needed data
	clean the dataset as needed, briefly explaining the need for each cleaning/analysis step
	show a figure that addresses your analysis question
	evaluate how the analysis and figure addresses your question
	run all the way through. (check by "restart kernel and run all cells" before uploading
