### Course Outline

Weeks 1-6 to focus on developing skills using toy data sets and prehaps a rangeof examples from the flavour datasets.  Weeks 7,8,9 to focus on usinghte dataset to test a hypothesis.

Week 1: Introduction to biological research questions and real-world datasets.
Individual classes on the different flavours with biological background provided by the staff member leading each dataset 

Week 2: Data entry, filtering and formatting Data entry, cleaning and summarising. 
Students will be taught best practices for entering and organising data and the coding required to manage this

Week 3: Data visualisation
How to choose appropriate visualisations for different data types.  Coding for producing a range of plot types, for data exploration.

Week 4: Inferential statistics 
Teaching the principals of testing variation between groups.  Coding to run bootstrapping tests. Describing commonly used approaches (t-tests).

Week 5: Multivariate analysis 1.
Introduction to the concepts of multivariate statistics.

Week 6: Multivariate analysis 2. 
How to visualise and interpret multivariate relationships in Python.  Using examples to provide a framework.

Week 7: Multivariate analysis 
Expanding using additional examples.

Week 8: Putting the results in biological context – more on the system
Interactive session where student groups are able to discuss with staff in charge of each dataset outcomes of their investigations.  Including a presentation from the “dataset coordinator” about the data and the advanced or wider implications/applications of the datasets 

Week 9: Principles of data presentation
Coding and principles for communicating data to, for example, avoid misleading or difficult to interpret figures

Week 10: Poster day
An event for students to display and present their posters, for assessment by staff and peers.  Will be accompanied by food and drinks at the Bayes Institute.


### Assessment
