### Why do you have to do this course?
    Data Science is a key part of all biology.  Whether the datasets are of counts of seabirds nests, levels of calcium in cell line cultures, expression of disease response genes, or hydrophobicity of protein domains, the same techniques can be used to manage and explore the data to look for meaningful patterns.

### What will this course teach you?
    We will build on the python you learnt last year to teach you data management and exploration using pandas and seaborn - two python-based modules.  You will learn how to enter, clean, and re-arrange data, how to merge and split datasets, how to produce basic summary statistics, how to use a variety of plots to explore the data, how to define groups and test relationships between them, how to use clustering to look for patterns in large datasets, how to reduce dimensions in large datasets using PCA.

### Why is this important?
    Many of the papers you will read over the next three years will use these techniques, the practical work you will do in lab and filed based courses will produce data which can be analysed usign these appraoches, the honours project you do in fourth year is likely to need good data managemetn and analyssi skills.  Once you graduate there are many careers where a soudn grasp of data science is required.

### How will we teach you?
    We will provide short introductory lectures and walk you through coding to illustrate the topics or each week, but much of he work will be done in groups  working through notebooks online.  The first class of each week will guide you through learning new techniques and the second class will give you more scope to explore how these techniques are used with real data to address biological questions.  Once you have a good grip of the techniques, you will choose a dataset and work as a group to explore it, producing a poster to describe your results.

### How will you be assessed?
    There will be weekly short online quizzes for you to check you are keeping up.  You will use your portfolio to describe your approach to your group data analysis project.   A time-limited analysis excercise will give you scope to show what you can do.  The final poster will be assessed by students and staff.

### What is expected from you
    You should review the lecture ppt and notebooks before class.  You need to make best use of class to learn from the demonstrators.  You need to manage your time in the group data analysis and work together to apply what you have learnt.

### What resources are available?
    Classes will be in person, using computer labs, but the work will be done on noteable so you can continue proactise outside class.  You will be provided with lots of help in class from demonstrators and can ask questions on the forum on learn at any time.  Links for useful outside resources will be provided in each week.
