### Week 2
This week is all about re-aranging your data.  It may seem very dull, and can certainly be frustrating to do sometimes, but having your data in the right format makes all further analysis much easier.
I will give you a brief introudciton to the idea of 'Tidy Data'.  The first workshop shows you some of the ways to achieve this, and the second workshop will let you practise these skills on some horribly formatted data sets.
